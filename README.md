# General
_To Do: refactor code to create classes for each processor, create outplaced running script, perform completely terminal usage_

This project idea is to emulate work of **mipt32/64** processors be executing their assembler code. Both are simple Neuman's machines - its programm and memory placed in one addresses space.
